}
\value{
A GRanges object consisting of aggregated junctional read count data
from all control and test samples. The GRanges object has at least three
metadata columns:
\itemize{
\item SJ_IR: whether the entry is counting split (SJ) or non-split (IR) reads at
the junction.
\item gene: the name of the gene which the junction occurs within or \code{NA} if the
junction is not with a gene
*count_sample_name: the count for each junction for a given sample. There
will be as many count_sample_name metadata columns as there are
sample_names specified
}
}
\description{
\code{selectGenesTranscripts} extracts split-reads from control and test .bam
files, counts them and aggregates the data into a single data table.
